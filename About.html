    <p class="h"><em>Hey! Akash here, I hail from the city of monuments, Agra. Beautiful city with architectural heritage and lively people who have helped me develop day but day.
So if I talk about myself, I have been good in academics and sports both. I have quite well maintained the balance and secured good marks in ISC board despite being the sports captain of the school. And talking about school, my school St. Peter's college has really helped me groom well. It didn't only focus on academics but also provided fair opportunities in extra curricular activities. I believe to have always been a leader, and sports and all just accentured these qualities of mine.

Speaking of my perspectives I don't fear losing. I think it's the part of journey towards success as we only learn on losing , so losing is what I believe is also essential.
I believe to never give up, although we might not be good at something, still we must not quit we must just keep fighting toward our goal. And at last I believe in " Palma non sine pulvere" ie no reward without labour</em></p>
